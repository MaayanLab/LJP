# LINCS Joint Project (LJP) - Breast Cancer Network Browser (BCNB)

[LJP-BCNB](http://amp.pharm.mssm.edu/LJP/) visualizes thousands of signatures from six breast cancer cell lines treated with ~100 single molecule perturbations, mostly kinase inhibitors. These perturbations were applied in different concentrations while gene expression was measured at different time points using the L1000 technology. Under the same conditions, the cells were imaged for cell viability. The distance between nodes represents response similarity computed using the cosine distance between the Characteristic Direction vectors of perturbations compared with their appropriate controls.
