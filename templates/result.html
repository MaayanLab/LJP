                LJP-BCNB visualizes thousands of signatures from six breast cancer cell lines treated with ~100 single
                molecule perturbations, mostly kinase inhibitors. These perturbations were applied in different
                concentrations while gene expression was measured at different time points using the <a class="alert-link"

                nodes represents response similarity computed using the cosine distance between the Characteristic Direction
                vectors of perturbations compared with their appropriate controls.
