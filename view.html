	This webpage visualizes thousands of responses of six cancer cell lines to approximately 100 single small molecule perturbations enriched with kinase inhibitors. Such perturbations applied under different concentration while gene expression was measured at different time points using the <a class="alert-link" href="http://www.lincscloud.org/l1000/">L1000 technology</a>. At the same time, all perturbations were profiled with high-content imaging to assess cell viabilities. The distance between nodes represents response similarity computed using the cosine distance between the Characteristic Direction vectors of perturbations compared with their appropriate controls.

	You can use the controls on the top-right to navigate the network as well as adjust the coloring, size and shape of the perturbations based on various classifications.
